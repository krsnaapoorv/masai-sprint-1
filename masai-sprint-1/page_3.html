       <h2 class="fabout">Rules</h2>
       <br>
       <ul>
          <h3>Court</h3>
          <li>The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only.The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of the same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.</li>
          <li>The full width of the court is 6.1 metres (20 ft), and in singles this width is reduced to 5.18 metres (17 ft). The full length of the court is 13.4 metres (44 ft). The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98 metres (6 ft 6 inch) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76 metres (2 ft 6 inch) from the back boundary.</li>

       </ul>
       <ul>
           <h3>Serving</h3>
           <li>When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents' court or it will count as a fault. The server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.</li>
           <li>At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite service courts.the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand inside their service courts, unlike tennis.</li>
           <li>In singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in her/his left service court when her/his score is odd.</li>
           <li>In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he/she changes service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time.</li>
       </ul>

       <ul>
           <h3>Scoring</h3>
           <li>Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served (this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15 points). A match is the best of three games.</li>
           <li>If the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such as 24â€“22), except when there is a tie at 29-all, in which the game goes to a golden point. Whoever scores this point will win.</li>
       </ul>
       <br>
       <h2 class="fabout">Technique</h2>
       <br>
       <h3>Strokes</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>Badminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of skill to perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either forehand or backhand.</li>
           <li>n the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rear court, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands, often preferring to play a round-the-head forehand overhead (a forehand "on the backhand side") rather than attempt a backhand overhead.</li>
           <li>Smash is the most popular and point giving stroke.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Position</h3>
       <ul>
           <li> Position of player as well as the position where the cork touches the raquets are important.</li>
           <li>Players position should be in the exact middle of the court such that he should be able to come back at its original position easily.Its a matter of pactice that player should cover the whole court in 2.5 steps around.</li>
           <li>The position of shuttle touching the raquets gives the spin to the shuttle ,which is very important to distract players.</li>
       </ul>
